## Game Description:

    Hyrule is under the threat of Ganon,
    and Princess Zelda has devised a plan
    that involves a potion brewed with a 
    special ingredient: Frogs!

    Link must journey through Hyrule
    searching for frogs endlessly so that he 
    can squish them with his Iron Boots. 
    Be careful though! The Iron Boots are so 
    heavy that you will immediatly sink upon 
    contact with water.

    Avoid lakes at all cost, jump over Octoroks 
    and search for Zelda's missing ingredient. 
    The world is counting on you!
